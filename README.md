## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used labeled twitter data .
This dataset includes 30,000 messages drawn from events including an earthquake in Haiti in 2010, an earthquake in Chile in 2010,
floods in Pakistan in 2010, super-storm Sandy in the U.S.A. in 2012, and news articles spanning a large number 
of years and 100s of different disasters. I built a pipeline to label incoming tweets with disaster related tags.
